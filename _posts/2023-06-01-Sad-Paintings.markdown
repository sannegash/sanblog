I have always loved looking at paintings and I wonder why? why they captivate so many?
They are like a medium of expressing the human condition, the sadness the joy the love 
even the brute uncertainty of life. I find myself staring at ones where the atmosphere 
is gloomy and the narrative is uncertain maybe like a character seating alone by the 
river side under the moonlight as they look at the distance (maybe its the poet in me) 
I just can't let it go its like a smoothing piano like a gentel breeze it washes over
me it given me
